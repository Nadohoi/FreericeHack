=== How to run the Freerice Hack on Replit ===


--- Importing from GitHub ---

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this,
so don't do it again :)

1. Create a new Repl, and click “Import from GitHub”
2. In GitHub URL, type “https://github.com/lafkpages/FreericeHack”, and press Enter
3. If it asks you for a command to run, type “./replit.sh”
4. If it asks what language it is, select “python3”


--- Running from Replit ---

1. Simply click the green Run button
  1.1. If it doesn't work:
    1.1.1. If it says “Freerice servers are unavailable”,
      it means that you have temporarely been banned
      from Freerice, or that the bot couldn't connect
      to the Freerice servers. Check you have WiFi, and
      just wait 5 to 15 minutes
    1.1.2. If it says “User controlled C”, it means that
      you pressed Control + C and you manually quit the bot
    1.1.3. If you get “Argument parsing error”, it means
      that invalid arguments were passed to the program,
      and that it automatically quit
    1.1.4. Anything else, just re-run the bot. If you still
      get the error, check that you have WiFi and wait
      5 to 15 minutes
  1.2. If it says “Replit: updating package configuration”,
    it means that Replit is updating packages. The first time
    you run, it might take a few seconds, but after, it should
    be quicker
2. If you want to pass extra arguments, you have to use the
  shell. Click were it says “Shell”, and type “python3 Requester.py”
  with any other arguments at the end. For a list of all arguments,
  type “python3 Requester.py --help” in the shell


--- Stopping the bot ---

Just go to the console and press Ctrl + C

Note: if you're on MacOS, make sure you press Control and not Command
